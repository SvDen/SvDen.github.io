Hello.

This is the place for my pet-projects.
Each new project (shown further) is better than the previous.

— SvDen.github.io/to-do/public/ — To Do list in pure JS based on Bootstrap.
Realized: functional inherity, working with local storage, building project with gulp using babel transpiller and other modules.

— SvDen.github.io/Chat/ — chat on WebSocket technology, the server is on c9.io.
Realized: creating a server in NodeJS, 
Note: sometimes server shuting down for unknown reason with no error. I guess it's because of hosting features, but who knows.
Anyway I have to restart it manually so if the chat tells you 'Server is not response' — don't worry and try again later or just call me.

— SvDen.github.io/practice-ecommerce/ — adaptive layout of a page + JS without external libraries. One of my first projects.
Realized: CSS-based carousel on pure JS and proper dislpay on any screen.
